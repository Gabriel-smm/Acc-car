Acc-car: Remote Car Controlled by user's hand movements with an Accelerometer (MPU-6050)

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a remote-controlled car that uses the data from an accelerometer sensor (MPU-6050) to control its movement. The sensor is attached to the user's hand, and by twisting their hand, the user can direct the car. This project demonstrates the integration of hardware and software for motion-based control systems.

Features
First part - Accelerometer-LED integration:
  Real-time motion detection using the MPU-6050 accelerometer.
  Control outputs for LEDs (as a prototype for motors) based on data from MPU.
  Modular design for easy replacement of LEDs with motors in the future.


Hardware Requirements
MPU-6050 accelerometer sensor
Microcontroller (Arduino)
5 LEDs (for prototype output)
Wires and breadboard for connections


Software Requirements
Arduino IDE
MPU-6050 library
Basic knowledge of C++
Hardware Diagram
(Add a simple diagram or schematic of the hardware setup here.)

Installation and Setup
Clone this repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-smm/Acc-car.git
cd Acc-car
Open the Arduino IDE and upload the code to your microcontroller.
Assemble the hardware as per the schematic provided.
Power on the system and observe the LED control based on hand movements.
Usage
Attach the MPU-6050 sensor to your hand.
Power on the system.
Twist your hand to see the corresponding LED actions.
(Future) Replace LEDs with motors for car control.
