My main idea here is to build a car which will be controlled by the information of an acceletometer sensor (MPU-6050). The sensor will be attached to my hand and, by twisting my hand, I will control the car's movement
I divided the project into some phases:

1) I researched about how to use the sensor (I used the code from https://youtu.be/L5QIFnurucU?si=xKRCkMZuyENVmj8u)
2) I soldered the pins of the sensor (and, yeah, it took long hours to do it)
3) I set the hardware and software part of the sensor
4) I set the hardware and software part of the LEDs
5) Finally, I connected both part: the data from the sensor and the LED

Obs: The idea here is to use the data from this sensor to produce an action, that, in this case, is turning an LED on. The next step is just substitute the LEDs for motors
