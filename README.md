-Remote Car Controlled by user's hand movements with an Accelerometer (MPU-6050)- 

Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to build a remote-controlled car that uses the data from an accelerometer sensor (MPU-6050) to control its movement. The sensor is attached to the user's hand, and by twisting their hand, the user can direct the car. This project demonstrates the integration of sensor's data collection and electronic actuators, as well as how to communicate data across devices with bluetooth, for motion-based control systems.


Features:

First part - Accelerometer-LED integration:

  -> Real-time motion detection using the MPU-6050 accelerometer.
  
  -> Control outputs for LEDs (as a prototype for motors) based on data from MPU.
  
  -> Modular design for easy replacement of LEDs with motors in the future.
  

Second Part - Sharing MPU's data trough bluetooth:

  -> To be done


Third Part - Tranforming MPU data into motion (motors):

  -> To be done

  

Hardware Requirements:

- First Part
    - MPU-6050 accelerometer sensor
    - Microcontroller (Arduino)
    - 5 LEDs (for prototype output)
    - Wires and breadboard for connections
    - Hardware schematic: ----


Software Requirements:
  - Arduino IDE
  - MPU-6050 library
  - Basic knowledge of C++
